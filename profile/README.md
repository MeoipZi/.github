## 🙋‍♀️ Introduction
# Vintage clothing promotion website to enhance accessibility and convenience of information search 
In the fashion industry, there are various services, such as a platform that integrates and shows several online shopping malls and a site where you can share reviews on products. 
However, consumers find it difficult to obtain information because there are not many such services in the used clothing industry, and the credibility of shopping malls' products decreases due to problems such as lack of reviews. 
A website has been developed to solve this problem and allow consumers to conveniently access shopping malls specializing in second-hand clothing. 
It provides a connection link to several shopping malls that sell vintage clothing at once, and creates a networking site that allows site users to share information and share opinions with each other.
Site users can post their own coordinates and provide the place and price of the clothes. 
It is also possible to leave likes and reviews on specific shopping malls and products. 
Other users who see this can immediately visit the shopping mall through the link, which can promote the consumption of second-hand clothing.
In addition, looking at coordination using vintage clothing, second-handed products are no longer rustic, but can be reborn as devices that satisfy users' fashion needs while thinking about the Earth's environment.
